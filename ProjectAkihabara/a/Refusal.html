		<p class="nametag">I knew it was challenging, I knew it was going to be tough. I couldn't help but be scared. Afterall, this is a new world and a new environment. I was scared.<strong> Fear stopped me from moving forward.</strong> There were times I wanted to give up, there were times I wanted to turn back. But I couldn't, because school had just started. I wanted to conquer high school, and I'll see it through to the end, no matter what.
