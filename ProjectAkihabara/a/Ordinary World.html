			<p class="nametag">My name is Josh Isaiah C. Dizon. I am born in Cebu and lived here ever since. My ordinary world is my hometown, and I've been here for as long as I can remember. It is my home, it is where my hearts belongs. My life was easy going in grade school. My classmates had been the same althroughout grade school, everything changed when we had graduated Grade 6. It was our final time together, as we were all going our own ways. I was no different, the friends I've spent so much time with, our paths were finally separating. It was tough for all of us to let go, but alas <strong>life goes on.</strong>
