			<p class="nametag">I've gotten many advice from many people and from many places. I am a firm believer in learning from everywhere and anywhere. I don't have any notable mentors, however I have met teachers and friends who gave me words of advice throughout the years. I also learned from books and fictional characters. I enjoy manga such as Vagabond which taught about how chasing a worldy title is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Another manga I thoroughly enjoy is Berserk, which goes into the topic of struggling in an unjust world <i>(Forewarning: it is not for everyone as it has heavy gore and violent themes)</i>. One can learn from anything and everything, and I've had many mentors throughout the years.</p>
