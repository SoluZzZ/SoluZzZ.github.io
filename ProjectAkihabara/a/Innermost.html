		<p class="nametag">An unprecedented event struck; the world was hit with a sudden pandemic. At first, many students like myself had believed it was just a few weeks off of school. School had ended and we thought we had just scored a longer summer. It was fun at first. Then days became weeks, weeks became months, and eventually the months became a year. We didn't know what to do. It was lonely. We missed our friends and we took our time for granted. One day I was informed that school would now move on to online class. I was anxious, I did not know what to expect. For the first time in two years, I was scared to go back to school. I did not know what to expect.
