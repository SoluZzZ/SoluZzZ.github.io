		<p class="nametag">There were many trials and tests throughout my school year. One time in Grade 7, we as a class had a dance performance and I had gotten in a fight because the girl's boyfriend got jealous of me. A heated arguement broke out and the class was torn. However I learned to no longer linger over it as it was childish and meaningless to argue over something like that. Grade 7 passed by and I met new friends along the way. I even made friends with people from other sections. It was hard adjusting at first, however I soon got the hang of things and Grade 7 was no longer much of an issue with my friends by my side. Three more years and I've had conquered high school.</p> 
		<p class="nametag">Grade 8 came and I was bummed that my former classmates and I had also been split up. But this granted a new opportunity to mingle with more people. I met new faces and reunited with old ones. Grade 8 was harder than Grade 7, however I learned to stay strong and be steadfast. Grade 8 was nearing its end and so I look back on the past 2 years I've had. Little did I know that my fun would end so abruptly with the emergence of something unprecedented, something beyond my control.
