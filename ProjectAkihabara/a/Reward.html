		<p class="nametag">I had come out of the year stronger. Sure I had felt weak at times, but ultimately, I stand on top of my endeavors. I had pushed myself to become an even stronger version of myself. Because of all the hardships and struggles, I calloused myself and became someone stronger. I know it sounds cliche, but the struggles served as a stepping stone for my growth. It hindered me back then, but looking back, I became more matured and mentally ready because of all that I've been through. Just as Miyamoto Musashi's* viewpoint changed when he had slaughtered the 70 Yoshioka, my viewpoint in life changed because of the online setup. <strong>I became stronger.</strong>
