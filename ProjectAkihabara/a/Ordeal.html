		<p class="nametag">It was a new era. I know I wasn't the only one, but I was scared. I was anxious. But, <i>life goes on.</i> So I went and ventured onto the world of online learning. It was beyond challenging. Suddenly having to wake up early, having low quality devices. I had to take drastic measures. It was challenging althroughout. At no point was it easy. Adjusting was difficult. I still miss face to face learning. There were times where I had been close to giving up. There were many times I felt burnt out. But I kept going on. I kept pushing. Sooner than I thought, I had come out of Grade 9 standing strong. I had conquered my ninth school year, in a new and unfamiliar environment no less. I had come out victorious over my hardships.
